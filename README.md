# DM Helper

Version 1.0

## Description
DM Helper is a Python-based application designed to assist Dungeon Masters in managing their Dungeons & Dragons tabletop games.

Current features include:
- Dice rolling: Automates dice rolls.
- Initiative tracker: Tracks combat order.
- Campaign notes: Organizes campaign notes.
- Character sheet viewer: Displays inputted data for characters for the DM to see stats.

## Purpose
I'm honing my Python skills and had this idea to help out my friends with a one-shot Dungeons & Dragons game we're planning. One of our buddies is taking a turn as DM, and since they're new to it, I thought I'd pitch in to make things smoother. Alongside assisting my friend as a DM, I also wanted to continue practicing my programming skills. This project serves as a practical way to advance my career in data analytics through hands-on experience.
